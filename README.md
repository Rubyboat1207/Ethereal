# reduceOS - the rewrite
Welcome to the in progress development of the new reduceOS.\
If you would like to learn more about the development of the kernel, scroll down.

#### Please read the credits!

# What's different?
I've switched off multiboot in favor of a custom assembly bootloader and kernel. More features are coming in the kernel rewrite along with a ton of flaws and bugs fixed.\
More info coming soon.

# Why does it look so messy?
The assembly code shouldn't look that messy. If it is, start a pull request/contact me and I will update it.

# What's the current stage?
Getting IDT, GDT, and HAL up and running

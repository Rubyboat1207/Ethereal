# reduceOS
A small, lightweight OS coded in C++ and Assembly.

# About
reduceOS is a small operating system built for people who have a very slow computer. It can do a few different things using barely any memory and disk space. \
This project was coded for fun. I don't intend for anyone to actually use this(although if you did, that would be cool).

# I wanna do this
Check out [this page](osdev.org) to start creating. I recommend starting from the beginning.

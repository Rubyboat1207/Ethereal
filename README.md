# reduceOS
A small, lightweight OS coded in C and Assembly.

# Dev Branch
Welcome to the dev branch, where I can experiment and release new builds to you!


# About
reduceOS is a small operating system built for people who have a very slow computer. It can do a few different things using barely any memory and disk space. \
This project was coded for fun. I don't intend for anyone to actually use this(although if you did, that would be cool).


# How to compile and run:
Step 1 - Download the source code.\
Step 2 - Run `make`\
Step 3 - Run `qemu-system-i386 build/reduce.bin`\
Step 4 - Enjoy!

## Windows builds do not currently work

# I wanna do this
Check out [this page](osdev.org) to start creating. I recommend starting from the beginning.

# reduceOS - the rewrite
Welcome to the in progress development of the new reduceOS.\
If you would like to learn more about the development of the kernel, scroll down.

#### Please read the credits!

# What's different?
I've switched off multiboot in favor of a custom assembly bootloader and kernel. More features are coming in the kernel rewrite along with a ton of flaws and bugs fixed.\
More info coming soon.

# Why does it look so messy?
My apologies, the code is currently still in testing phase, meaning there is barely any commentation in the kernel and bootloader. This will be fixed later.

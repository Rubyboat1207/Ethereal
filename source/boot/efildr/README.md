# Polyaniline EFILDR

EFILDR is a GNU-EFI based program that will load the main Polyaniline program.

It requires you to have OVMF installed and accessible at /usr/share/ovmf, as that is where qemu will have it run.

**Full list of packages required:** ovmf mkisofs gnu-efi

**This bootloader is in experimental stages and does not run on BIOS/EFI machines. You will have better luck with the BIOSLDR bootloader (and it doesn't even work).**

/*
reduceOS was a journey I started back in the beginning of 2022. That's probably not that long ago, but who knows.
Back then, I just copied and pasted whatever code I found (mostly from pritamzope, thanks for being so chill about it bro).
This resulted in an unbuildable base, with me having no knowledge of what to do. I later gave up and started from scratch.
Around September of 2022, I picked up reduceOS again, for the rewrite, and that brings us to today.
I could have never dreamed that one of my goals as a very young child would finally be fufilled.
Thank you to everyone who helped support my dream, whether directly or indirectly.
Thank you to all the sources used to make this rewrite.
Thank you to my friends and family for supporting me on this dream.
I hope you enjoy reduceOS, the rewrite.

(P.S: Don't look in this file if you don't want spoilers!)
